# matchnspin

This node express project contains code I wrote for a demo to a provisional patent application that I filed for years ago. I'm releasing the code in the following 2 files under the MIT license,

matchnspin/public/javascripts/match-n-spin.coffee
matchnspin/public/javascripts/match-n-spin.js

Maybe someone feels like pulling out the parts related specifically to Match3, and making a game framework.

The graphics assets are included so that you can actually run the demo, but should not be considered open source.

Another game is included in the chainpoker.coffee, and chainpoker.js files. Those are also not open source, but may be in the future. 
Basically, I pushed those files out without being ready, so... there they are. A fair amount of it overlaps with the match-n-spin files.

More info on both projects (chainpoker == PokerMatch) is available at my youtube channel, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4ABe7Bug8M&t

If you want help figuring the code out, you can DM me on twitter at UpperCayce, or on facebook.com/tollison
